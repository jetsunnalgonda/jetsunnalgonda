# Hi there, I'm Haluk üëã

I'm a research scientist and a software developer interested in building web and mobile applications using modern technologies. My primary areas of expertise are Javascript, React, Next.js, and iOS development. I'm always eager to learn new things and keep up with the latest trends in the tech industry.

## üî≠ Some of My Previous Projects

- [React Task Tracker](https://github.com/jetsunnalgonda/react-task-tracker): A simple Full-stack task tracker application that was done in Javascript using React.

- [SPT Rocks!](https://github.com/jetsunnalgonda/SPTRocks): SPT Rocks! is an iOS App that I built which is also featured in a scientific article that I published in the Computer Applications for Engineering Education. It is a geotechnical application to use with the Standard Penetration Test which is a common in-situ test in geotechnical engineering for assessing the soil properties.

- [Zodiac Signs for iOS](https://github.com/jetsunnalgonda/Zodiac-Signs): Zodiac Signs is an iOS app that lets users connect to their Facebook profiles and based on their information given, provides comprehensive details about their zodiac signs.

- [Good Crop](https://github.com/jetsunnalgonda/Good-Crop): Good Crop is an app that I developed for iOS in Objective-C that can crop pictures, collage them into one frame with arbitrary triangular shapes that the user provides or rectangles. This was achieved by making heavy use of trigonometric functions. 

## üå± What I'm Learning

I'm currently learning about both front-end and back-end technologies. On the front-end, I'm exploring new front-end frameworks like Vue.js and Svelte, and learning how to build responsive and accessible user interfaces. On the back-end, I'm diving deeper into serverless architectures and how to build scalable applications using AWS Lambda and API Gateway. I'm also learning about database technologies like MongoDB and PostgreSQL
